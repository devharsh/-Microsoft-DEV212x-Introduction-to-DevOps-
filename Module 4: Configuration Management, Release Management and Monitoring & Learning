Question 1
(10/10 points)

What are some of the benefits of describing your infrastructure and configuration as code? Select three.

-> Facilitates automation
-> Provides environment consistency
-> Allows configuration to be version controlled

Explanation

Infrastructure and configuration as code facilitates automation, provides environment consistency and allows configuration to be version controlled.

Infrastructure and configuration as code does not prevent developers from updating configuration. That could be a policy in place in your organization, however, DevOps best practices would suggest a collaboration between developers and operations staff.

Additionally, configuration as code generally prevents, or at least discourages, configuration changes to be made directly in production environments. Instead, all changes should go through version control.

Question 2
(10/10 points)

Which two of the following statements best reflect how configuration management in a DevOps environment differs from traditional configuration management.

-> Configuration management in a DevOps environment emphasizes encapsulation of configuration in code over formal documentation.
-> Configuration management in a DevOps environment is often less formal than traditional configuration management.

Explanation

Having configuration as code is one of the core principles of DevOps. Although organizations implementing DevOps are free to establish formal change and configuration control protocols, these are not required to adopt DevOps.

Question 3

Deployment pipelines have several characteristics. Select the three answers that best describe the characteristics of a deployment pipeline.

-> Automates the deployment of code to environments
-> Enforces automated or manual approval gates
-> Runs available automated tests against the deployed environment

Explanation

Deployment pipelines automate the deployment of code to environments, enforce automated or manual approval gates, and run available automated tests against the deployed environment. Not all of these characteristics need be present in early deployment pipelines, however, they are core characteristics to mature deployment pipelines.

Deployment pipelines do not generally compile code and run unit tests. This is generally done by the Build pipeline. In some tools, build and deployment is supported together, however, it is a good practice to compile once, and deploy the compiled and tested code from environment to environment. Additionally, they generally do not run a build at every commit. That is common to a continuous integration environment, and is generally separate, at least conceptually, from a deployment pipeline.

Which of the following statements describes Release Management as it applies to DevOps?

-> Release Management enables automated releases to multiple environments with approvals.

Explanation

Release Management generally describes managing releases into multiple environment with either automated or manual approval steps.

Checking builds into source control, approval by a change control board, and documenting code changes may be good (or bad) practices for a given environment, but are not a required part of how release management is used in a DevOps environment.

Question 5
(10/10 points)

Which statement below most accurately describes Application Performance Monitoring (APM)?

-> Monitoring usage and performance metrics in production.

Explanation

Application Performance Monitoring (APM) is used, among other things, to monitor usage and performance metrics of an application in production.

Often, based on APM metrics a team will configure tools to autoscale servers (including RAM, CPU and disk space), however this is not a core part of APM. Instead, it is in response to APM measurements. Additionally, although performing load tests while measuring responses with an APM tool is often done, it is not the core purpose of APM. Finally, the time between code check-in and deployment is an excellent measure, however it is not related to APM.
